Description: Java implementation of a binary protocol for web services
 Hessian provides compact binary and XML protocols for applications
 needing performance without protocol complexity.  It is well-suited to
 sending binary data without any need to extend the protocol with attachments.
 This library also includes Burlap that is a matching XML protocol.
 .
 With Hessian, providing a web service is as simple as creating a servlet and
 using a service is as simple as a JDK Proxy interface.
